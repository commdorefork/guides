# Introduction: What is a plan?

A plan is a document that guides your actions toward a goal. It describes the internal and external conditions and how you change as they change over time. It describes the parts involved and the method in which you reach your goal. A recipe is a plan for food. A recipe shows the ingredients and the steps to chop, mix, and cook your food. Good plans develop over time as experience increases. It's important to write down your plan, so it can be tested for effectiveness. You modify your plan to account for new information you learn so you can do better in the future. Your plan may be one page or several pages depending on how much experience you have. 

# The parts of a plan

There are 4 main parts to a plan: the resources involved, the method, the competition, and the the market and costomer, along with a summary, description, and a journal of your trials, inspirations, and experience.

Summary and description
- The summary details basic information like what type of things you are building, what industry it is in, and what kind of financing you will need to make it possible. It's the giving and recieivng aspect or the value proposition. It is a quick overview.
- The description should expand on the summary in any way that needs to be detailed. This adds detail to the product, and the market, and talks about the problem being faced, the need, the causes, and how it will solve the problem.

Internal factors
- The resources should be in detail of the current resources you currently have and the resources you will need to develop whatever it is you plan to develop. In recipes this is the ingredient list. It lists where to get them, the price, and the drawbacks and benefits of alternatives that you may use.
- The method are step by step instructions to use and develop the resources in some way. Pseudo code in programming is a great way to write this out. It should include quantities of repetitions of actions and if-then statements detailing what to do when some external conditional problem appears.

External factors
- The competition goes into the existing alternatives to your solution along with how you affect each other going through the process of developing and using the product.
- The market should detail your customers, how much demand there is, their needs, and how they will use your product. It will also detail things like where your product will be served.

- Use a journal to talk about the things you try and fail at, along with the things you try and succeed with. Also note resources you find along the way that help, esspecially any inspirational models that show you a way forward to mastery.

The external factors will change the internal factors, and the internal factors will change the external factors. When factors change over time, you need to account for the changes some how and change your plan accordingly.
