# Know your environment

One day your parent takes you to this strange place where you are left alone with someone called a teacher. What a strange place this is. Kids play merrily and when this so called teacher tell kids to do something they listen. Sometimes kids cry. Sometimes kids act out. In that sense the teacher acts as a parent who knows better. But for the most part this goes on... and on... and on... So lets examine this a bit more closely shall we. What is this thing called school? What is it there for? Why is it the way it is? What good does it do? Why do you go? Do teachers really know better? What risks and dangers lurk around the corners? What troubles are kids confronted with?

# A short history of the rising of the beast

Historically school has been considered a kind of chairity. Politians use is to control the population. Industrial society needed a workforce.

## The letdown curriculum

The misdirected student goes to a variety of classes--art, social studies, math, language arts, science, and gym. In art, the teacher assigns a variety of projects. The student, having not yet been revealed to him how to develop skill, moves on from project to project. There he develops no great skill in any one thing, and has an unmemorable experience. At best, he develops interest in something and takes it up as a hobby. Not knowing the job market, the student doesn't realize art is not realistic for anything more than a hobby. In social studies, the student learns the social values of the state. It has a perscribed curculim that does not cover the breadth of human interaction, nor does it touch in how to develop and practice healthy human relationships. Math is a very important topic because math applies to everything. We are strung along in basic math for most of our k-12 education. We are not given any overview or good insight. This leaves many frustrated and lost students in math, not realizing it's importance or beauty. Language arts gives us readings we may not be interested in. This literature represents a pitiful fraction of the diversity in language. Reading this bewilders students, and leaves them unable to properly develop critical thought. After the student's interest in the literature has waned, he is told to write critical essays about it. He is left alone in hope to develop good grammar, broad vocabulary, and critical thinking skills. There is only the hope that he takes some interest in reading and and comes across good references he's not too tired to read to develop accurate grammar, broad vocabularies, and flexible thinking skills. The reading and the lack of help leaves the student feeling disinterested and incompetent with english. He may wonder how the great writers do it. Only those with talent, strong interest in reading, or helpful parents go on to become anything more than average writers and thinkers. Science is a very important topic. Yet today science is just regurgitated. A smattering of ideas are taught. Students sit patientially as if they are vessels to be filled up. Curiousity and the scientific method is not given the space it needs to develop. Science is a process more than anything. Students sit in their desk regurgitating facts and formulas. Interest wanes and questions arise, asking what this all is really for or what use it is. When the student goes to gym, he is presented with the competitive mindset. There are games, actions, and excitement. For the exhausted student this adds further stress to them. They are taught to one up each other and made to feel worthless if the student is not at peak physical ability. If someone steps out of line, punishments are given by running around the track or doing some painful exercise. This wears students out and makes them disinclined to exercise naturally as they grow up.

## The curriculum of mastery

In a beneficial form of education, the curriculum would foster your concentration and investigation to develop wisdom to cope with the day to day demands of the world. It would teach you design thinking. It would teach you how to access resources in the world--information and goods. It would teach you research. It would teach you how to think with a broad and inquisitive mind. It would foster curiousity and motivation, as well as providing deep technical insights into your area of interest. It would allow you to dream and go after what is most interested to you. It would teach you to plan and execute and how to manage risk and adversity. It would teach you what there is and how it can be constructed. It would teach you how to develop healthy relationships with stuff, yourself, and other people. It would teach you about the current issues facing the world, and how you can interact with the world in ways that promote the good of yourself and others. And it would do all this while being organized, efficient and logical. It would not take twelve years to learn the basics. It would take a fraction of the time, and it would be self directed and interesting. You would learn the terminology, and then repeat a practice until you've mastered something that you find interesting. How well is the curciulum doing this for you today?

English, Math, and programming would be considered the language trinity. Students would first learn by becoming familiar with all the symbols and categories of vocabulary. Broad thinking skills and vocabulary would be developed by using good references to discover and create a treasury in your mind that you can use to think with. Likewise, references for grammar and pronunciation would be used to give people access to the resources to really understand. Effort would be applied to adopt and integrate this into their own writing and thinking style. Students would learn to research using libraries and choose whatever seeks their fancy to explore and read. These thinking skills would naturally help develop artistic skill, and art projects would naturally develop once provides the resources. Interesting art projects that students choose would be repeated until skill is developed. All of math would be introduced early. Vectors, probability, statistics, integrals, derivates and all mathematical objects would be introduced. Instead of mastering any one, a very insightful and broad view of math would be developed, which would foster the students interest and recognition of how universal math is. Then students would be taught to fluently write and think in mathematical terms, and problems of similar nature would be offered for students to choose and practice until mastered. This would utterly accelerate and kindle advanced fluency and a rapid pace. Biology, chemistry, and physics would be learned in a similar fashion. Students would be able to navigate the literature and explore. A basic understanding would give students the foundation to develop deeper knowledge. How we develop curiousity would be used by asking questions and exploring the world. We would be given rich experiences where questions would be raised about how something occured. Then hypothesis are reflected on, and then we would be taught to use tools to test these hypothesis. This would naturally stimulate more thought, and the process would continue at a natural pace. When stuck, we will be taught to research high efficiency resources to gain insight. Engineering and fabrication would also be taught. We would learn the design process, and we can use our new found technical insights to fabricate designs. Social studies, physical studies, and self studies would teach about lifestyles, dysfunction systems, benefits and drawbacks of systems. It would not be used to reinforce the status que. It would allow interaction, and as problems arise, insights into how to manage these situations would be presented. This would help develop health as the student learns to interact with the environment. It would make us think outside the box and head toward creative solutions to long standing problems.

Survival tips:
1. Take charge of your education. Explore libraries, the internet, and develop a vocabulary. We can not depend on these out of date insutitions to do it for us. They are steeped in tradition and inefficiency.
2. Explore university bookstores
3. Build up some references like rogets thesaurus, a good grammar book, and abc and all their tricks. 
4. The oxford guide to library research will help with your researching skills.
5. Join a makerspace, and get involved in only communities with technical knowledge.
6. After you develop a vocabulary, repeat a complex task until skill develops and your abilities advance.

This still isn't easy, and we need individuals to create good content and reading lists that are refined and efficient. There's so much innovation and potential, and we need people to develop this. We can not wait for the rigid schools to do it.


## The schedule of weariness

In the morning, the exhausted student hears his alarm go off. He gropes to press the snooze button for a few more minutes of sleep. When the time constraint to get to school urges him up, he drags himself out of bed and uses the washroom. Then while feeling kind of woozy he makes his way to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. There he thinks how miserable his life has become and how aweful he feels. After he has got ready to go he stumbles to the bus stop and gets to school for the the bell of first class. Sometimes he enters late because he is moving so slowly or got a few more minutes of sleep and is subjected to the nerves of walking in late. In his desk, as he listens to the teacher, the teachers presentation seem dull and boring. He may put his head down on the desk as he's finding it hard to keep his eyes open. Between classes, he is bomboarded with a flurry of excitement and action that he can barely process, and results in him tightening up out of anxiety. As class after class drone on, he becomes hungry. His blood sugar is dropping, and he is running out of energy. With no time to snack between lectures, his energy drops further. During lunch he looks over all the pop and sugary juice in the cafateria that spike his blood sugar and give a resulting hypoglycemic drop, which just drains him further. The saturated fat in the deep fried food and meat clog his insulin, preventing glucose from entering the cells. But he has youth going for him, so he copes with it better, but it prevents him from feeling at his peek potential. And it sets him up for further health complications down the road. After lunch, he feels a little more alert, but now gym is after lunch, and one kid acts off and the whole group is forced to do laps around the track. Stress hormones surge through his body, and he just wants this day to be over with. After it's all over, he gets home and just wants to lay down and watch the tv or scroll through the internet. The last thing he is able to do is study more. Without enough energy to stretch and rest, stress accumulates day to day as he goes through this cycle, and his mental health deterioriates, and he eventually enters depression and develops mental illnesses. His interest in life wanes, and he feels depressed, unable to tolerate the demands of life. He goes to bed, and gets up to do it all again the next day five days a week, with little time to recover fully. The situation deterioriates until there is a breaking point and he becomes mentally ill and locks himself away. Only the people who handle stress well and get good sleep make it through this unscathed.

## A schedule of high concentration

In a higher form of education, the schedule would be used to coordinate meetings at your leisure. It would be used to bring together people in collaboration and self directed learning with the aid of a teacher. If the student gets weary or hungry, he can take a refreshing break to reflect and contemplate what he learned while recovering from an intense and productive study session. If the student needs to take a day off to destress by stretching and resting and recover his full concentration and energy, he is able to, so that he is at peak performance for the following days.

Survival tips:
1. Stand up, petition, and demand free days off and rest breaks with well written arguements and case stories for students who are exhausted. Teachers and policy makers need to plan for better flexibility for students to sleep and recover.
2. If you need it bad, you have to be brave and honest with your support network about the rest you need, and demand time off.
3. On your time off if you have a time to rest, stretch like your health depends on it. It really does. The difference between kids K-6 and how some older kids feel is how much you stretch.
4. If you are a zombie, then the only solution is to quit. I know it's controverstial to some and theres bs propaganda to keep kids in school, but these people don't understand the hell some kids are going through. If they had any idea of how wasteful this time is to kids who are zombies and the hell they're going through, they'd speak to a different tune. Some time off and time to stretch and get back in good health even if you have to homeschool is well worth it. Youth rebounds quickly, and even just a week or two can turn a kids life around and become happier and more alert.
5. Learn the skill of balance, and don't let anyone persuade you out of it.


## The distracted classroom


As the bell rings, the restrained student makes his way to class and finds his desk. For most of the class, he sits patiently listening to the teacher, scribbling down notes half distracted. When he doesn't understand something time is not taken to slow down and take a closer look at it, distracting him further. He is rushed through inefficient lectures. The teacher regurgitates information wasting time that could be used to interact with students. If a student has a question he has to be brave enough to raise his hand infront of the class to ask it. At the end he is given uninteresting drills to repeat and struggle with. There is no chance for breaks to reflect on what one has learned, so the student begins to become a mindless drone. Only the quick witted and alert students survive.

## The classroom of engagement and utility

In a quiet room, students would use efficient study material. Efficiency would be quantified by a high insights/length ratio. The more insights over a shorter length of study material, the greater the efficiency of the study material. Students could slow down their intake of information to really grasp an idea before moving onto the next. A teacher would be at ready availability to answer questions and redirect the eager student in enlightening directions. In another room, students would collaboarte in projects they are interested in, and engage in hands on group problem solving. Students would get used to time management and coordinating work among the students. Because the student is actively engaged, he or she would absorb the material much better.

Surival tips:
1. Read your textbook before class so you are more absorbed and less distracted in the material. It's like driving a car and talking.
2. Take as much as your teachers time as you need. Seek out alternative programs and clubs if you have time, like fab labs and makerspaces.


## Peers and Bullies

The student going through puberty goes to school. His hormones are raging. Students feel attraction towards the opposite sex. There's competition between peers. He cares deeply how he appears to others. They are bombarded into a oneupmanship battle. Tests and gym reinforce this battle. He is bombarded by all this social stimulis. The student may become afraid and develop a lot of inner conflict. Students are bound to be distracted!

In a consoling educational system, there would be places that students could go to decompress and relax alone. With other people, we also need our alone time to stay healthy except the most socially resilant people. Then more focus can be put on studies. And social studies would help us navigate this social landscape.

Survival tips.
1. Don't be afraid to take time out even if you do it on your own. Be confident with appearing alone sometimes.
2. Steady your mind and meditate. Don't get caught up in all these signals your peers are giving off. Develop a steady mind that can withstand the attractions and repulsions. Bring positive and negative together to destroy them both. Develop balanace.

## The untimely tests

The endeavoring student does his best to learn the material if he is not too distracted in class and lost in the material. The exhausted and disinterested student completely glosses over the material and fails. Tests are given at regular intervals at the end of the course. The student crams for the test, and anxiously takes it. Only the students who follow dutifully along with the course do well. The rest resign to lower than top marks, injuring their self worth. They are made to feel less then able, when it is not their fault. It is the education system that poorly executes on vulnerable populations.

In a confident educational system, tests would be given at regular intervals throughout the year, say monthly or quarterly. The student would choose when he felt confident taking the test, which would lead to higher grades, and more self worth. People would feel great more often about their results. They would be well prepared and it would represent success not failure.

Surivial tips:
1. Follow along. Do your course work. 
2. Make a simple page that sums up everything you've learned. Use this page to develop a treasury inside your mind.
3. Don't beat yourself up if you fail, It doesn't make you any less worthy.

# WTF

Where the heck are we at?
This education system is shameful! Not people but the system should be utterly disrespected!
