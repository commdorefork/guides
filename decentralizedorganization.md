# Organizations with decentralized power based off the scientific method for social good.


# Organizational structure


There are three departments in the product cycle: Research and create guidance, use guidance and develop products, use products, and create feedback and reviews for research. This is a cycle that is parallel to the scientific method: hypothesis, test, feedback. Science is really good at finding credible information because this model is good at stumbling around until a valid solution is found. Using this model in organizations could be a powerful way to find and develop solutions.


There are two other parts. That is the communication and connections of products and people. And two fields to help start up and shut down. This helps get them going and continue to function smoothly and well.


This model is potentially highly effectiving and developing and reaching solutions together.


The following three fields develop, guide, and provide feedback. These are the departments based off the scientific method. These are like the car that stumbles along until we find direction and get somewhere.
Would you like to collect feedback and research and set out guidelines that we can follow to help people better collectively reach our goals? Think consulting, surveys, accounting, finance, legal help, intellectual property, budgeting, analysis, statistics, philosophy, science, health & safety standards, trends, stress management guidance, risk management, performance appraisal, planning, forecasting, strategy, pricing, auditing, historian, information integrity.
Would you like to use guidelines to help develop products that can be used to benefit? Think R&D, innovation, design, ergonomics, health & safety, project management, packaging, problem solving, manufacturing, maintenance and repair, web development and programming, technology, literature, art.
Would you like to test out products you're interested in and provide feedback on them? Think quality assurance, critic, appraisal, reviews.


The following two fields help get the process flowing. These are like the fuel that powers the car.
Would you like to help connect people with people and products? Think recruitment, scout, outsourcing, teams, logistics, supply chain management, donors, solicitation, sales, facilities, home working, joint ventures, taxation, retirement.
Would you like to connect people with information about causes and products? Think marketing, memes, branding, presentation, advertising, web marketing, art, news, public speaking, printing, broadcasting.


The following two fields help keep it the process flowing smoothly. These help with creation and destruction.These are like the grease that allows it to keep flowing smoothly or grind it to a halt. 
Would you like to help brainstorm, research, help people gather information, and get people going on their path? Think training, coaching, reference librarian, education, motivation, participation, guides, entrepreneurs, organizers, analytical writer, career planning, job hunting.
Would you like to help people get along with one another? Think contracts, conflict management, negotiation, compensation, win/win, culture, oversight, communication, employee relations, public relations, security.


# Decentralized Power and effective process.


The current organizations like business and government consolidate the powerful parts of this structure and oversee it. The problem with this is that potentially a small number of people can get in their hands a lot of power. For example in government decision making and money is both directed by the elected officials. This potentially can create corruption or poor uses of power. To keep this from happening, i've thought up several constraints that would decentralize power so that no one person has centralized control while everyone still works together for the best possible outcome.


- Supply of money has to be separated from the decision makers
- Decision makers make guidelines instead of authoritative decisions
- Everyone is a decision maker in their field and own part of that property. We all collectively work together.
- Pay and votes is put proportionally into everyone's hands without such extremes that would tip the balance of power
- Everyone reads guidelines to decide what products and areas of business to fund. What needs it the most? And what is ok to choose by your own opinion. The guidelines and research are accessible and widely distributed so they are put forth in people's field of awareness.
- People who make guidelines use evidence based feedback and are clear with people of the consequences that have occured due to people's choices.
- There is transparency and checks to make sure the guidelines are based on accurate data, and the guidelines logically follow the data.
- The operations are transparents and reproducible, so people can fork it in case of corruption or opposition from other powers in play with top down structures.
- The people who gather and distribute money are bound by law and contract not to own and distribute money with not an overly unequal distribution. Based on fair market value. All extra money is re-distributed evenly to boost people's income or to give people voting money to support causes and products.
- Conflict resolution is owned by votes by informed citizens and social good
- Conflict resolution helps grease and stop actions that are harmful.
- People give good feedback.
- Product development follow guidelines, especially for health
