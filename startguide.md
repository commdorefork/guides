# Introduction


You came here for a reason. Maybe you want to help others or are disheartened by what you see in the world and aren't sure what you can do. Maybe you have an idea, but you need help with accomplishing something that will collectively improve quality of life for all of us. The first step by being here is to define what makes you tick. What is your passion in life? What makes you get up every morning? If nothing, we are here to help you find that. This will be your niche. The next step is to do research into your niche to find out what you can do about it. Once you have done your research, you are ready to create a mission statement that you can share with the world and strive for collectively.


# NicheCraft: finding your purpose in life


A niche is what motivates you in life that you want to offer. It's what drives you to get up every day to help do. To get motivated, you need to find your niche! Many people make the mistake of trying to be "all over the map" when picking a niche. Try to be specific as possible with what drives you.


It should
- It's highly motivating for you.
- It's specific.
- Somebody could be helped by it.
- It's uniquely yours.


Here are some questions that can help find your niche:
    
- What motivates you? If you aren't motivated by your niche then we won't collectively get anywhere. Motivation is the foundation of your niche. It's what makes you tick and makes you feel like you have a place here. Here are some questions to help identify your motivation: What are the problems and issues you've faced in life and how are they related? When are times in your life that you've been really motivated to make a change? What was the cause of that? What have you really enjoyed doing in your life? What's your life story? Try combining your interests, issues, and life together to find one purpose that really gets your engine running.
- What brought you here? What were you looking for by coming here?
- Who is your chosen demographic that you want to help? Try to be as specific as possible with whom you want to help. What is your demographics worldview? When you figure out your demographics worldview, you can better tailor your goal for them.
- What do you want to offer? Try to be as specific as possible. To help identify what you want to offer try making a list of things you do best. What have been your achievements in life? What are the most important lessons you have learned in life? Are there specific patterns in the way you solve your problem? If you can't think of anything you're good at or have no achievements, how can we help you learn what you need to know to help you with your highest motivation?


# Research your Mission


Once you have your niche figured out, the next step is to do research into the causes and consequences of your niche. Your Mission is what you will do to contribute to your niche. Here are some questions to help you figure out what your mission will actually be based on the research you do.
- What is the issue or problem you are facing? What are the consequences?
- What is the cause of your issue?
- What solutions can you think up that will solve this issue?
- What will it look like when you solve this issue?


# Make a mission statement


Once you've figured out your mission, it's time to write out exactly what you will do about it in a clear statement of intention. Your mission statement is the solution you've found for your mission. It's what you'll do about it. While your niche is like your foundation, your mission can evolve and change over time. Your mission statement should be concrete and inspire action now.


Here are some questions that can help you start brainstorming ideas of what you want to contribute.


The following three fields develop, guide, and provide feedback. These are like the car that stumbles along until we find direction and get somewhere.
Would you like to collect feedback and research and set out guidelines that we can follow to help people better collectively reach our goals? Think consulting, surveys, accounting, finance, legal help, intellectual property, budgeting, analysis, statistics, philosophy, science, health & safety standards, trends, stress management guidance, risk management, performance appraisal, planning, forecasting, strategy, pricing, auditing, historian, information integrity.
Would you like to use guidelines to help develop products that can be used to benefit? Think R&D, innovation, design, ergonomics, health & safety, project management, packaging, problem solving, manufacturing, maintenance and repair, web development and programming, technology, literature, art.
Would you like to test out products you're interested in and provide feedback on them? Think quality assurance, critic, appraisal, reviews.


The following two fields help get the process flowing. These are like the fuel that powers the car.
Would you like to help connect people with people and products? Think recruitment, scout, outsourcing, teams, logistics, supply chain management, donors, solicitation, sales, facilities, home working, joint ventures, taxation, retirement.
Would you like to connect people with information about causes and products? Think marketing, memes, branding, presentation, advertising, web marketing, art, news, public speaking, printing, broadcasting.


The following two fields help keep it the process flowing smoothly. These are like the grease that allows it to keep flowing smoothly or grind it to a halt. 
Would you like to help brainstorm, research, help people gather information, and get people going on their path? Think training, coaching, reference librarian, education, motivation, participation, guides, entrepreneurs, organizers, analytical writer, career planning, job hunting.
Would you like to help people get along with one another? Think contracts, conflict management, negotiation, compensation, win/win, culture, oversight, communication, employee relations, public relations, security.
