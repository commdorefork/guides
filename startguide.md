# Introduction


You came here for a reason. Maybe you want to help others or are disheartened by what you see in the world and aren't sure what you can do. Maybe you have an idea, but you need help with accomplishing something that will collectively improve quality of life for all of us. The first step by being here is to define what makes you tick. What is your passion in life? What makes you get up every morning? If nothing, we are here to help you find or create that. This is your mission or purpose. The next step is to do research into your mission to find out what you can do about it. Once you have done your research, you are ready to pick up a role, and start setting some goals that can get you headed in that direction.


# How to find your highest purpose.


Your purpose is a problem that brings you joy by solving it. It's a problem you've been trying to solve your entire life. It's your greatest challenge meets your highest joy. It's what drives you to get up every day to help do. Your purpose is what makes you tick and makes you feel like you have a place. To develop passion, you first need to find your purpose!

It should be
- It's specific.
- Somebody could be helped by it.
- It's uniquely yours.

Here are some questions that can help find your passion:
- What do you enjoy doing the most? What have you really enjoyed doing in your life?What have you really enjoyed doing in your life? When are times in your life that you've been really motivated to make a change? What are rewarding activities for you? 
- What are the biggest obstacles you've faced in your life? What have you been trying to solve your entire life? What has been the sequence of challenges you've faced in your life? How are they connected?
- Try combining your interests, issues, and life together to find one purpose that really gets your engine running.
- What brought you here? What were you looking for by coming here?
- Who is your chosen demographic that you want to help? Try to be as specific as possible with whom you want to help. What is your demographics worldview? How does that relate to the challenges you've seen?
- What do you want to offer or see better in the world? Try to be as specific as possible. To help identify what you want to offer try making a list of things you do best. What have been your achievements in life? What are the most important lessons you have learned in life? Are there specific patterns in the way you solve your problems? If you can't think of anything you're good at or have no achievements, how can we help you learn what you need to know to help you with your highest purpose?

# How do you develop passion?
